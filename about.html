            <h3>WHY PROGRAMMING? WHY NOW?</h3>
            <p>I have always been a computer guy, from mucking around on my parents 486 to getting sent to the principals office for "accidentally" installing Commander Keen onto my 4th grade teachers laptop. I always wanted to be in the IT industry in some fashion, but lost the path at some point along the way. After some motivation from close friends making a transition over from unrelated industries, I have decided to make the move and run head first into my new career.</p>

            <h3>PREVIOUS LIFE</h3>
            <p>Although I have most recently come from a technical trades background, I have previously worked with digital media as a digital marketing coordinator for a tech start up in Melbourne. I was initially hired as a copy writer/ social media manager, but quickly progressed into managing a small group of designers and marketing managers taking care of large assignments. We were tasked with full business re-branding, media schedules, website and mobile app launches, guerilla marketing and community engagement, just to name a few of the areas we were responsible for. Being a start-up environment, I wore many hats and mostly self taught along the way. </p>

            <h3>INTERESTS & ASPIRATIONS</h3>
            <p>I am an avid gardener, love my podcasts (history, comedy and current affairs) and love to while away an afternoon playing a board game or a bit of PS4.  </p>
